Report of Changes - AIS Data Engineering Project

1. Project Architecture Overhaul:
   - Shifted from a single data pipeline to dual pipelines (real-time and historical).
   - Added explicit raw data storage (PostgreSQL) to ensure data persistence and failure recovery.
   - Integrated unified enriched data storage for consistency.

2. New Data Sources:
   - Replaced the temporarily unavailable AIS API with Digitraffic Marine Traffic API (real-time WebSocket and REST endpoints).
   - Added MarineFinland.fi and SYKE Environmental APIs for complementary environmental data (e.g., water quality, weather).

3. Tooling Adjustments:
   - Adopted Folium for map visualization (replaced initial placeholder tools).
   - Added Flask as the API framework for querying data.
   - Standardized on PostgreSQL for relational data storage.

4. Documentation:
   - Created a Mermaid.js architecture diagram to visualize the system.
   - Drafted a Data Management Plan (DMP) outline.

New Data Sources:
- Digitraffic Marine Traffic API: Real-time AIS data for Finnish waters.
- MarineFinland.fi: Environmental data (water temperature, ice).
- SYKE APIs: Hydrology and phytoplankton data enrichment.
- EMODNET: EU-wide AIS data for cross-border analysis.
