Data Management Plan (DMP) - AIS Data Engineering Project

1. Data Collection & Use:
   - Primary Data: AIS data (real-time and historical) from Digitraffic API.
   - Environmental Data: Water quality and weather data from MarineFinland.fi and SYKE APIs.

2. FAIR Principles:
   - Findable: Metadata stored in PostgreSQL; APIs documented with OpenAPI/Swagger.
   - Accessible: Raw data via SQL queries; enriched data via REST API.
   - Interoperable: Data formats include JSON, CSV/Parquet, and SQL.
   - Reusable: Public datasets licensed under CC BY 4.0.

3. Methodologies & Standards:
   - Data Standards: IEC 62320-1 for AIS; Dublin Core for metadata.
   - Tools: Python (Pandas, TensorFlow), PostgreSQL, Flask.

4. Data Curation:
   - Cleaning: Remove duplicates, invalid coordinates, and outliers.
   - Enrichment: AI/ML model for trajectory prediction.

5. Ownership & Rights:
   - Ownership: AIS data (public domain); enriched data (project team).
   - Licensing: Project data under CC BY-SA 4.0.

6. Data Accessibility:
   - During Project: Internal access via PostgreSQL; external access via Flask API.
   - Post-Project: Public Zenodo repository for datasets; code on GitLab.

7. Ethics & Security:
   - Ethics: No PII stored; environmental data used for non-commercial research.
   - Security: Database encrypted at rest; API endpoints use HTTPS.

8. Costs:
   - Storage: Free tier (AWS).
   - Processing: Free tier for ML (Google Colab).
